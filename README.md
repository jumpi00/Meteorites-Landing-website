> Questions:

X [COMPLETED] The P5 visualisation works well with the data, but the loop stops working after two rounds. We don't know why.

X [COMPLETED] The D3 diagrams are cut. We don't know if itâ€™s because of the div or something we need to do with the D3 code. 

X [COMPLETED] We wanted to integrate a little interaction with the continent-regions buttons. So the map and the ridgeline only show that information.

The second chart too should interact with the buttons.

Adding the graticule for the map. We manage to create the paths but the lines looked strange

Delete the libraries we don't need

Add a transition to the buttons filtering
 
> In addition, we are going to try to do this:

Change the colour of the map

Add a tooltip to the map. Hover to show the country name --> strange effect https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/bubblemap_tooltip.html
